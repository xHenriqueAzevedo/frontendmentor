## My process
This was a very simple project.

It followed a streamlined approach, emphasizing the application of correct HTML semantic structuring and CSS organization.

The HTML was basic but still I tried to structure it with the latest correct semantics, encapsulating the content in a main container, pictures in the correct figure tag, etc.

At the CSS aspect, I initiated by creating the prescribed font with a @font-face, to utilize  throughout the challenge. Subsequently, I declared the main variables, liable to repetition, like the color scheme and diverse font weights.

Next step was resetting the default CSS values. I proceeded to the vertical and horizontal alignment of the main container employing flex. Recognizing that the container possessed a fixed width of 322px, I decided to maintain consistency between desktop and mobile displays since the breakpoint  was 375px. I also incorporated margins to ensure aesthetic integrity when viewed on narrower screens not overlapping the screen sides.

Within the container, I opted to use a grid-based layout, especially to utilize 'gap' for an effective and constant separation of the elements. A strategy was adopted by encapsulating the gap and border attributes within variables, facilitating future modifications and adjustments that could be deemed necessary.

The subsequent phase was basic css application to faithfully replicate the challenge design, effectively addressing the challenge posed.


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

I mainly use this project to further entrench my knowladge in HTML and CSS correct apllication.


### Continued development

My approach is to initiate the website development process by focusing on more straightforward simple designs and progressively advancing to more intricate and challenging ones. This methodology stems from a thorough period of study and is underpinned by a resolute dedication to acquiring valuable experience.

The ultimate objective is to secure a position within the frontend development. As I continue to refine my skills and accumulate practical insights, I hope to rise my expertise to a level that aligns with the demands and expectations of a professional frontend developer role.
